## Prettier:

Prettier will, after enabling the settings, allow for your files to be auto
formatted on save ensuring the code has a consistent format

> NOTE: If not using VS Code, or if you just want more information, check out
> the [Prettier editor integration docs](https://prettier.io/docs/en/editors.html).

Setup Steps:

1. Add the Prettier extension to VS Code.
1. **(optional) If you don't want prettier to format absolutely everything, set
   "prettier.requireConfig": true in your USER settings for VS Code. Adding that
   as a user setting will only format projects that have defined a .prettierrc
   file.**
